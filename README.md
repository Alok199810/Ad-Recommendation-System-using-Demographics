# Ad-Recommendation-System-using-Demographics
 Developed an end-to-end machine learning-based web application that predicts the most relevant advertisement for a user based on their demographic information (age, gender, income level). The system processes input data, matches it against ad targeting criteria, and outputs the most suitable ad category (e.g., Sports, Drama, Action).

This project predicts the most relevant advertisement for a user based on their **age**, **gender**, and **income level**. It uses a simple web interface built with **Node.js** and **Python**...

## 🔍 What It Does

- Takes user input (age, gender, income level)
- Compares it with ad targeting data (`ads.csv`)
- Suggests the most suitable ad (e.g., Sports, Drama, etc.)
